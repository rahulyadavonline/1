        <p>The common objective of green buildings is to reduce the overall impact of the built environment on human health and the natural environment by:</p>
        <p>Efficiently using energy, water, and other resources</p>
        <p>Protecting occupant health and improving employee productivity</p>
        <p>Reducing waste, pollution and environmental degradation</p>
        <p>A similar concept is natural building, which is usually on a smaller scale and tends to focus on the use of natural materials that are available locally.[5] Other related topics include sustainable design and green architecture. Sustainability may be defined as meeting the needs of present generations without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their needs.[6] Although some green building programs don't address the issue of the retrofitting existing homes, others do, especially through public schemes for energy efficient refurbishment. Green construction principles can easily be applied to retrofit work as well as new construction.</p>
        <p>A 2009 report by the U.S. General Services Administration found 12 sustainably-designed buildings that cost less to operate and have excellent energy performance. In addition, occupants were overall more satisfied with the building than those in typical commercial buildings.These are eco-friendly buildings.</p>
